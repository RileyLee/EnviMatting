	<p>
		Matting and compositing a reflective/refractive object like a glass cup into a new environment and make it look realistic from different perspectives is an interesting generalization of traditional greenscreen matting. Douglas et al. introduced the environment matting method to simulate reflection/refraction effect for single perspective in 1999 [1]. To solve our multi-view environment matting problem, we implemented the traditional single-image environment [2] method and incorporated interpolation to generate environment matting for unseen perspectives. Experiments using DSLR images and iPhone videos demonstrate promising results for both single-view enviroment matting and interpolation. We also did experiments with Lytro-Illum camera and structure from motion to calibrate camera positions. They didn't turn out to be successful but is a great lesson to learn.
